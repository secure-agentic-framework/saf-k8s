# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MEASURE 2.7

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: AI system security and resilience - as identified in the MAP function - are evaluated and documented.

## Mapping Notes

STRIDE threat modeling evaluates security posture across six threat categories. MITRE ATT&CK mapping evaluates defense coverage across attack tactics. ML threat taxonomy evaluates AI-specific attack resilience. Runtime security tools continuously evaluate system security.
