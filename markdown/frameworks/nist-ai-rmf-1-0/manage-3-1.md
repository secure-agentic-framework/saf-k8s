# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MANAGE 3.1

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: AI risks and benefits from third-party resources are regularly monitored, and risk controls are applied and documented.

## Mapping Notes

Dependency tracking with SLSA build provenance monitors third-party component risks. Vulnerability prioritization for AI workloads provides ongoing risk assessment. Restricted use policies govern external AI service consumption.
