# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MANAGE 1.3

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: Responses to the AI risks deemed high priority, as identified by the MAP function, are developed, planned, and documented. Risk response options can include mitigating, transferring, avoiding, or accepting.

## Mapping Notes

IR lifecycle playbooks define response procedures for AI-specific incidents (compromised training, model poisoning, GPU cryptomining). Containment strategies document specific mitigation actions.
