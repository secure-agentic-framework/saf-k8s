# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MANAGE 3.2

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: Pre-trained models which are used for development are monitored as part of AI system regular monitoring and maintenance.

## Mapping Notes

Model signing and provenance verification ensures pre-trained model integrity. Model registry hardening protects stored models. ML dependency vulnerability management tracks vulnerabilities in model dependencies.
