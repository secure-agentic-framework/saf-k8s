# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - GOVERN 4.1

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: Organizational policies and practices are in place to foster a critical thinking and safety-first mindset in the design, development, deployment, and uses of AI systems to minimize potential negative impacts.

## Mapping Notes

AI system classification enforces risk-proportionate controls. Model promotion gates require validation before deployment, embedding a safety-first workflow in the AI lifecycle.
