# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - GOVERN 3.2

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: Policies and procedures are in place to define and differentiate roles and responsibilities for human-AI configurations and oversight of AI systems.

## Mapping Notes

AI system classification assigns control profiles based on risk tier, implicitly defining human oversight requirements. Model promotion gates enforce approval workflows requiring human review before deployment.
