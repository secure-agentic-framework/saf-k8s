# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - GOVERN 1.2

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: The characteristics of trustworthy AI are integrated into organizational policies, processes, procedures, and practices.

## Mapping Notes

Policy-as-code engines enforce trustworthiness requirements (image provenance, resource limits, security contexts) as admission-time policies. Compliance mapping documents link organizational AI policies to infrastructure enforcement points.
