# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MAP 4.1

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: Approaches for mapping AI technology and legal risks of its components - including the use of third-party data or software - are in place, followed, and documented, as are risks of infringement of a third-party's intellectual property or other rights.

## Mapping Notes

SBOM and ML-BOM generation documents all software and model dependencies. ML dependency vulnerability management tracks known vulnerabilities in third-party components.
