# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MAP 3.2

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: Potential harms to people, organizations, and ecosystems arising from the AI system's intended use - and if relevant, across the lifecycle - are understood, characterized, and documented.

## Mapping Notes

ML threat taxonomy (CTA-2114) characterizes AI-specific harms including data poisoning, model disclosure, and evasion attacks. MITRE ATT&CK mapping documents infrastructure attack surfaces and potential harms.
