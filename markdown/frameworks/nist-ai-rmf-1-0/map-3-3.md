# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MAP 3.3

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: Representativeness and relevance of the AI system's training, testing, and evaluation data is analyzed and documented.

## Mapping Notes

Training data provenance and pipeline integrity controls establish data lineage. Data poisoning and label attack detection identifies data quality issues that may affect representativeness.
