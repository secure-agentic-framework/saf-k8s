# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MEASURE 2.5

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: The AI system to be deployed is demonstrated to be valid and reliable. Limitations of the generalizability beyond the conditions under which the technology was developed are documented.

## Mapping Notes

Model promotion gates enforce validation before production deployment. Model signing and provenance verification establish artifact integrity through the deployment pipeline.
