# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MAP 2.1

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: The specific tasks and methods used to implement the tasks that the AI system will support are defined (e.g., classifiers, generative models, recommenders).

## Mapping Notes

AI system classification requires documenting system type (training, serving, pipeline) and assigning appropriate control profiles. Label standards classify workloads by type.
