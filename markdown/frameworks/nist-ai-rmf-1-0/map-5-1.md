# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MAP 5.1

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: Likelihood and severity of each identified impact of the AI system's use, misuse, or failure - including effects on impacted communities - are assessed and documented.

## Mapping Notes

OCTAVE risk assessment includes impact severity scoring and prioritization based on organizational risk tolerance. ML threat taxonomy documents failure modes and their impacts.
