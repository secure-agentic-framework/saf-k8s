# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - GOVERN 1.7

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: Processes and procedures are in place for decommissioning and phasing out AI systems safely and in a manner that does not increase risks or harms.

## Mapping Notes

SAF-K8S requires secure decommissioning procedures including cleanup of data, artifacts, reservations, secrets, and access grants. Change management enforces approval workflows for model deployment lifecycle transitions.
