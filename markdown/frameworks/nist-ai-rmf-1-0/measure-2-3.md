# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MEASURE 2.3

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: AI system performance or assurance criteria are measured qualitatively or quantitatively and demonstrated for conditions similar to deployment conditions. Measurement results regarding AI system trustworthiness in deployment conditions and across the AI lifecycle are documented.

## Mapping Notes

AI workload telemetry measures performance in production conditions. Distributed tracing tracks behavior across ML pipeline stages from training through serving.
