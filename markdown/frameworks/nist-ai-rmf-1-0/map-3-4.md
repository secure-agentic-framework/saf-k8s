# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MAP 3.4

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: Risks and benefits of all datasets used for training, testing, and operation of the AI system are mapped, including those provided by third parties.

## Mapping Notes

Training data provenance tracks dataset origin and integrity. Large-scale data integrity verification validates dataset completeness. Data type classification labels categorize data flowing through pipelines.
