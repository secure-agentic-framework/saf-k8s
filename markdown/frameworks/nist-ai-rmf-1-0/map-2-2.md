# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MAP 2.2

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: Information about the AI system's knowledge limits and how system output may be utilized and overseen by humans is documented. Documentation also includes a description of the capabilities the system can and cannot support, its intended scope of operation, and conditions under which it would not be advisable to deploy the system.

## Mapping Notes

Inference request validation and response filtering enforce operational boundaries. Adversarial example defenses help define system reliability limits.
