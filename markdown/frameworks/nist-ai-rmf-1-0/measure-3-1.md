# NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 - MEASURE 3.1

- Framework Code: NIST-AI-RMF
- Requirement Title: Approaches, personnel, and documentation are in place to regularly identify and track existing, unanticipated, and emergent AI risks based on factors such as intended and actual performance in deployed contexts.

## Mapping Notes

Threat intelligence integration consumes CVE feeds, runtime threat intelligence, and adversarial ML attack pattern libraries. Security posture management provides continuous risk assessment with drift detection.
