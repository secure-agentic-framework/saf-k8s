# NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 5.2.0 - AU-8

- Framework Code: NIST-800-53R5
- Requirement Title: Time Stamps

## Mapping Notes

Accurate timestamps for agent action correlation

2.3 - Host OS and Kernel Hardening (node time synchronization with authoritative time sources, drift monitoring, and timestamp integrity); 10.1 - Audit logging (timestamps in audit records for forensic accuracy and event correlation)
