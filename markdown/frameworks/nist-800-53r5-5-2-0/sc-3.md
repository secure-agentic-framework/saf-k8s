# NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 5.2.0 - SC-3

- Framework Code: NIST-800-53R5
- Requirement Title: Security Function Isolation

## Mapping Notes

Isolating security functions in agent systems prevents compromise of authorization and audit

1.3 - Control plane component isolation; 2.2 - Sandboxed runtimes (security function isolation)
