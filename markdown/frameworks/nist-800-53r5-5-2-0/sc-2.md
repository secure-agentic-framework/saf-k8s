# NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 5.2.0 - SC-2

- Framework Code: NIST-800-53R5
- Requirement Title: Separation of System and User Functionality

## Mapping Notes

Separating agent system functions from user-facing interfaces prevents privilege escalation

7.2 - Namespace isolation (system vs user workload separation); 1.3 - Control plane component isolation
