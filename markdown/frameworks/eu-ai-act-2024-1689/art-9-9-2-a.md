# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Art-9:9(2)(a)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Risk Management System

## Mapping Notes

The risk management system shall comprise the identification and analysis of the known and the reasonably foreseeable risks that the high-risk AI system can pose to health, safety or fundamental rights when used in accordance with its intended purpose.

SAF-K8S threat modeling controls (STRIDE, OCTAVE, MITRE ATT&CK mapping) in D10 KA 10.3 address infrastructure and AI-specific threat identification. Health, safety, and fundamental rights risk analysis is an application-layer and organizational concern.
