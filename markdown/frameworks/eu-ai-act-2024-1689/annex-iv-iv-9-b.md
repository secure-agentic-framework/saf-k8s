# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Annex-IV:IV(9)(b)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Technical Documentation Referred to in Article 11(1)

## Mapping Notes

The degree to which the logging enables adequate tracing of the AI system's functioning throughout its lifecycle.

SAF-K8S provides tracing infrastructure through distributed tracing, deployment history, pipeline execution records, and model versioning. However, ensuring adequate tracing of AI system functioning requires application-layer instrumentation (inference logging, decision auditing) beyond platform-level tracing.
