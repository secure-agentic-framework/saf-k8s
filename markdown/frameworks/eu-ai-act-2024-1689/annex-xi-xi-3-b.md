# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Annex-XI:XI(3)(b)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Technical Documentation for Providers of General-Purpose AI Models Referred to in Article 53(1)(a)

## Mapping Notes

A description of the measures taken to address the limitations referred to in point (a), including information on the safety measures put in place.

SAF-K8S provides infrastructure-level safety measures: workload isolation (D3), resource limits (D8), network segmentation (D5), and monitoring (D10). Application-layer safety measures (guardrails, content filtering) are outside SAF-K8S scope but run on SAF-K8S-managed infrastructure.
