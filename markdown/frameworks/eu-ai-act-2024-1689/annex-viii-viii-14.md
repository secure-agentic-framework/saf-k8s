# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Annex-VIII:VIII(14)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Information to be Submitted Upon the Registration of High-Risk AI Systems in Accordance with Article 49

## Mapping Notes

A description of the means of identification of the AI system, such as a serial number, version number, or model identifier.

SAF-K8S supply chain controls (D6) support identification through container image digests, model version tracking via ML-BOMs, workload labels, and cryptographic attestation. However, defining the identification scheme (serial numbers, model identifiers) for regulatory registration is an organizational decision.
