# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Annex-IX:IX(7)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Information to be Submitted Upon Registration for Testing in Real World Conditions in Accordance with Article 60

## Mapping Notes

A description of the safeguards and risk mitigation measures put in place, including the measures taken to protect the fundamental rights and personal data of the subjects of the testing.

SAF-K8S provides technical safeguards relevant to real-world testing: workload isolation (D3), network segmentation (D5), access controls (D4), and data protection controls (D7). Fundamental rights protections and organizational safeguards are outside SAF-K8S scope.
