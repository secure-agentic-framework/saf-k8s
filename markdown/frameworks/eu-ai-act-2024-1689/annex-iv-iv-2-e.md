## Mapping Notes

A description of the relevant changes made to the system through its lifecycle.

SAF-K8S GitOps and supply chain controls (D6) track infrastructure-level changes via version control, container image tagging, deployment history, and audit logs. However, lifecycle changes also include application-layer changes (model architecture, training data, hyperparameters) that may not be captured by platform controls alone.
