# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Annex-IV:IV(3)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Technical Documentation Referred to in Article 11(1)

## Mapping Notes

Detailed information about the monitoring, functioning and control of the AI system, in particular with regard to: its capabilities and limitations in performance, including the degrees of accuracy for specific persons or groups on which the system is intended to be used and the overall expected level of accuracy in relation to its intended purpose; the foreseeable unintended outcomes and sources of risks to health and safety, fundamental rights and discrimination, taking into account the intended purpose of the AI system; the human oversight measures needed in accordance with Article 14, including the technical measures put in place to facilitate the interpretation of the outputs of AI systems by the deployers; the specifications on input data, as appropriate.

SAF-K8S observability stack (D10) provides performance monitoring, anomaly detection, and audit logging. Human oversight tooling integration and input data specifications require application-layer implementation, but SAF-K8S provides the infrastructure backbone.
