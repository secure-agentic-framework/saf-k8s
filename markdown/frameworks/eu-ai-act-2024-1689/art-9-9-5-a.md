# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Art-9:9(5)(a)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Risk Management System

## Mapping Notes

Risk management measures shall ensure elimination or reduction of risks in as far as technically feasible through adequate design and development of the high-risk AI system.

SAF-K8S controls implement risk reduction through secure design: minimal base images, least-privilege access, default-deny networking, supply chain integrity, and runtime hardening.
