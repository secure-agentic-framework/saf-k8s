# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Article-9.6

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Risk management system

## Mapping Notes

High-risk AI systems shall be tested for the purpose of identifying the most appropriate and targeted risk management measures. Testing shall ensure that high-risk AI systems perform consistently for their intended purpose and that they are in compliance with the requirements set out in this Section.

SAF-K8S supports testing infrastructure through CI/CD pipeline security (D6 KA 6.6), model promotion gates (SAF-K8S-0905-005), and validation controls. The design of specific AI system tests is an application-layer concern.
