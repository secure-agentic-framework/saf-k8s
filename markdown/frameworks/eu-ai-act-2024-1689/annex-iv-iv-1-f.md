# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Annex-IV:IV(1)(f)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Technical Documentation Referred to in Article 11(1)

## Mapping Notes

Where relevant, information about the use of pre-trained systems and other third-party tools integrated into the AI system, as well as information about the training data used to train those systems.

SAF-K8S supply chain controls (D6) track model provenance via ML-BOMs and SBOMs. Container image scanning and registry controls verify third-party components. Full upstream training data documentation requires organizational effort.
