# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Annex-IV:IV(2)(b)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Technical Documentation Referred to in Article 11(1)

## Mapping Notes

Information about the monitoring, functioning and control of the AI system, in particular with regard to its capabilities and limitations in performance, the degrees of accuracy for specific persons or groups of persons on which the system is intended to be used and the overall expected level of accuracy in relation to its intended purpose, the foreseeable unintended outcomes and sources of risks to health and safety, fundamental rights and discrimination.

SAF-K8S observability controls (D10) provide monitoring infrastructure, performance metrics collection, and anomaly detection. Accuracy measurement, bias assessment, and risk documentation are application-layer concerns, though SAF-K8S supplies the telemetry pipeline.
