# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Annex-VI:VI(3)(a)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Conformity Assessment Procedure Based on Internal Control Referred to in Article 43(2)

## Mapping Notes

The provider examines the information and documentation collected in accordance with Annex IV to assess the compliance of the AI system with the relevant essential requirements.

SAF-K8S generates much of the technical documentation referenced in Annex IV: system architecture records, cybersecurity controls documentation, logging configurations, change tracking artifacts, and post-market monitoring infrastructure evidence. However, the act of examining documentation for compliance is an organizational activity.
