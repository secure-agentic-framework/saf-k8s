# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Annex-XI:XI(2)(c)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Technical Documentation for Providers of General-Purpose AI Models Referred to in Article 53(1)(a)

## Mapping Notes

Where applicable, a description of the fine-tuning procedures that were applied, including the fine-tuning data used and how the fine-tuning affected the model's performance on the specific tasks.

SAF-K8S tracks fine-tuning job execution, resource consumption, and model versioning through ML-BOM lineage. Fine-tuning methodology documentation is application-layer, but SAF-K8S provides the infrastructure audit trail.
