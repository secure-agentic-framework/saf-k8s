## Mapping Notes

A description of the processes used for the evaluation and testing of the model, including the results thereof and any measures taken to address any identified risk.

SAF-K8S CI/CD pipeline controls (D6) enforce security testing gates, vulnerability scanning, and automated evaluation pipelines. However, model evaluation processes (accuracy, fairness, robustness testing) go beyond security scanning and require application-layer test design and analysis.
