# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Article-11.1

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Technical documentation

## Mapping Notes

The technical documentation of a high-risk AI system shall be drawn up before that system is placed on the market or put into service and shall be kept up-to date. The technical documentation shall be drawn up in such a way as to demonstrate that the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements set out in this Section and to provide national competent authorities and notified bodies with the necessary information in a clear and comprehensive form to assess the compliance of the AI system with those requirements. It shall contain, at a minimum, the elements set out in Annex IV. SMEs, including start-ups, may provide the elements of the technical documentation specified in Annex IV in a simplified manner. To that end, the Commission shall establish a simplified technical documentation form targeted at the needs of small and microenterprises. Where an SME, including a start-up, opts to provide the information required in Annex IV in a simplified manner, it shall use the form referred to in this paragraph. Notified bodies shall accept the form for the purposes of the conformity assessment.

SAF-K8S supports technical documentation through ML-BOM generation (SAF-K8S-0604-002), SBOM generation (SAF-K8S-0604-001), model provenance tracking (D9 KA 9.5), and training data provenance (D9 KA 9.6). The organizational obligation to produce and maintain comprehensive technical documentation is out of scope; SAF-K8S provides the infrastructure artifacts that feed into that documentation.
