# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Annex-IV:IV(1)(d)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Technical Documentation Referred to in Article 11(1)

## Mapping Notes

A description of the system architecture explaining how software components build on or feed into each other and of the computational resources used to develop, train, test and validate the AI system.

SAF-K8S directly captures system architecture through Kubernetes deployment manifests, service topologies, resource quotas, GPU allocations (D8), and pipeline DAG definitions (D9). Computational resource tracking is native to Kubernetes scheduling.
