# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Article-12.2.a

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Record-keeping

## Mapping Notes

identifying situations that may result in the high-risk AI system presenting a risk within the meaning of Article 79(1) or in a substantial modification;

SAF-K8S audit and monitoring controls capture platform-level events relevant to risk detection: resource anomalies, unauthorized access, and configuration changes that constitute substantial modifications. Application-layer risk events (accuracy drift, output quality degradation) require AI-specific instrumentation beyond platform controls.
