# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Article-12.2

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Record-keeping

## Mapping Notes

In order to ensure a level of traceability of the functioning of a high-risk AI system that is appropriate to the intended purpose of the system, logging capabilities shall enable the recording of events relevant for:

SAF-K8S audit and monitoring controls capture platform-level events relevant to risk detection: resource anomalies, unauthorized access, and configuration changes that constitute substantial modifications. Application-layer risk events (accuracy drift, output quality degradation) require AI-specific instrumentation beyond platform controls.
