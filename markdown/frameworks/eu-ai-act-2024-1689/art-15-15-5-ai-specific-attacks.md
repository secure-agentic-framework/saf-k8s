# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Art-15:15(5)-ai-specific-attacks

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Accuracy, Robustness and Cybersecurity

## Mapping Notes

The technical solutions to address AI specific vulnerabilities shall include, where appropriate, measures to prevent, detect, respond to, resolve and control for attacks trying to manipulate the training data set (data poisoning), or pre-trained components used in training (model poisoning), inputs designed to cause the AI model to make a mistake (adversarial examples or model evasion), confidentiality attacks or model flaws.

Directly maps to SAF-K8S D9 controls: data poisoning defense (KA 9.6), model supply chain integrity (KA 9.5), adversarial input defense (KA 9.3), model extraction prevention (KA 9.8), and inference request validation (KA 9.2).
