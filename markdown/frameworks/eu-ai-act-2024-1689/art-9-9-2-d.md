# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Art-9:9(2)(d)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Risk Management System

## Mapping Notes

The risk management system shall comprise the adoption of appropriate and targeted risk management measures designed to address the risks identified pursuant to point (a).

SAF-K8S controls ARE risk management measures for infrastructure-level risks: network policies, workload isolation, access controls, supply chain integrity, and runtime security all address identified risks.
