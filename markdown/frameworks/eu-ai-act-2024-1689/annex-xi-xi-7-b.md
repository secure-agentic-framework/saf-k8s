# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Annex-XI:XI(7)(b)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Technical Documentation for Providers of General-Purpose AI Models Referred to in Article 53(1)(a)

## Mapping Notes

For general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, a description of the safety and security evaluations conducted.

SAF-K8S provides security evaluation infrastructure (vulnerability scanning, penetration testing support, security gate enforcement) through D6 and D10 controls. Safety evaluation methodology and documentation are application-layer concerns.
