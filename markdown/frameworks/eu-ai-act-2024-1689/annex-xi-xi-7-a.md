# EU AI Act 2024/1689 - Annex-XI:XI(7)(a)

- Framework Code: EU-AI-ACT
- Requirement Title: Technical Documentation for Providers of General-Purpose AI Models Referred to in Article 53(1)(a)

## Mapping Notes

For general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, information about the computational resources used for training the model, the amount of training data, and the total compute used.

SAF-K8S GPU tracking (D8), resource quota management, and training pipeline telemetry (D9/D10) directly capture compute resources, training data volumes, and total FLOPS consumed during training on Kubernetes infrastructure.
